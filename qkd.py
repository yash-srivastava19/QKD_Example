which we can send individual photons. The polarization of the phioton can be used to 
represent a qubit.

""" 
QKD Protocol involves repeating this process enough times so that an eavesdropper
has a negligible chance of getting away with this interception. Steps Involved :

Step 1 : 

--> Alice chooses a string of random bits, and a random choice of basis for each bit.
Alice keeps these two pieces of information to herself. 

Step 2:

--> Alice then encodes each bit into a string of qubits using the basis she chose, and
sends to Bob.

Step 3:

--> Bob measures each qubit at random, using a random basis, and keeps the result private

Step 4:

--> Bob and Alice then publicly share which basis they used for each qubit. If Bob
measured a qubit in the same basis as Alice prepared it, they use this to form part 
of their shared secret key, otherwise disccard the information for that bit.

Step 5:

--> Finally, Bob and Alice share a random sample of their keys, and if the samples 
match, they can be sure(a small margin of error is allowed) that their transmission 
is successful.
